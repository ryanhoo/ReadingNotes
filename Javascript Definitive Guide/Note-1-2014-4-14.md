## Chapter 1

### 1.1 学习的过程从来都不是线性的
> But learning a new programming language is never a linear process, and describing a language is not linear either: each language feature is related to other features and this book is full of cross-references—sometimes backward and sometimes forward to material you have not yet read.

### 1.2 Javascript Object
> An object is a collection of name/value pairs, or a string to value map.

> —— Page 5

使用对象属性有两种方法：

1. '.'语法
2. []数组下标

```javascript
var object = {
	name: 'ryan',
	age: 23
}
object.name = 'ryan hoo'
object['age'] = 24
```

### 1.3 Preview of Function and Method
> A **function** is a named and parametrized block of JavaScript code that you define once, and can then invoke over and over again. 

> When we combine functions with objects, we get **methods**.
