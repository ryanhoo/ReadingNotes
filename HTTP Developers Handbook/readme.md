### The HTTP Developer's Handbook

> HTTP is the protocol that powers the Web. As Web applications become more sophisticated, and as emerging technologies continue to rely heavily on HTTP, understanding this protocol is becoming more and more essential for professional Web developers. By learning HTTP protocol, Web developers gain a deeper understanding of the Web's architecture and can create even better Web applications that are more reliable, faster, and more secure.

> The HTTP Developer's Handbook is written specifically for Web developers. It begins by introducing the protocol and explaining it in a straightforward manner. It then illustrates how to leverage this information to improve applications. Extensive information and examples are given covering a wide variety of issues, such as state and session management, caching, SSL, software architecture, and application security.

### Why HTTP?
HTTP协议是Web项目中最为基础的一环，但是却往往被人忽视。受我师傅的熏陶，才慢慢认识到HTTP的重要性。

新团队里，服务端使用PHP，接口设计风格竟然是RPC！！！更让人难以忍受的是，HTTP在这里的体现仅有三点：

- Get：get everything ~
- Post: only for uploading image
- Status Code: 200 means successful request, others are failure...

所以希望能通过业余时间的学习，掌握HTTP协议，对此能有一个全局的认知，能知道项目中如何运用。然后在团队中推广开来，比如RESTful风格的接口设计~

### Targets

学习内容为HTTP Protocol V1.1，资源为：

- HTTP Developer's Handbook
- HTTP Definitive Guide
- HTTP 1.1 rfc2616 1999
- RESTful

目前看来，HTTP Developer's Handbook最为精炼，短小精悍，有nightire大神推荐，品质有保证。

配合HTTP标准文档为理论基础，RESTful等实际应用为导向的进行学习与实践。
